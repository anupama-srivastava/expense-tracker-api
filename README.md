## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 15
- Redis

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd expense-tracker-api

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up --build

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Access the API
# httpThe TODO.md outlines a clear plan for implementing the AI features, and it appears that the project is in progress. Here’s a summary of the findings and the necessary updates:

### Summary of Findings:
1. **README.md**: Contains comprehensive information but has repetitive sections that need to be cleaned up.
2. **Models**: 
   - The **expenses** app has well-defined models for managing expenses, including recurring and split expenses.
   - The **AI** app has models for expense predictions, anomaly detection, and budget recommendations.
   - The **social** app includes models for shared expenses, family budgets, and expense challenges.
   - The **voice** app has models for voice commands and OCR receipt processing.
3. **URLs**: The main URLs configuration is set up correctly, but it needs to include WebSocket routing for analytics.
4. **Docker**: The docker-compose.yml is well-structured for running the application with PostgreSQL and Redis.
5. **TODO.md**: Lists tasks for implementing AI features, with some tasks marked as completed.

### Proposed Updates:
1. **README.md**: 
   - Remove repetitive sections and ensure clarity.
   - Update the documentation to reflect the current status of features and any new additions.
2. **URLs Configuration**: 
   - Update the URLs to include WebSocket routing for the analytics app.
3. **TODO.md**: 
   - Ensure that the current status reflects the latest progress and update any completed tasks.

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with the updates to the README.md and URLs configuration.
- After making the changes, I will check if any additional updates are needed in the TODO.md.

Let me start by updating the README.md to remove the repetitive sections and ensure clarity.
